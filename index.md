## About Me
Hi! I’m Jiayi — but you can call me Chai.\
I’m a Computer Science graduate from DigiPen Institute of Technology, where I specialized in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. Over the past four years, I’ve collaborated on multiple team-based game projects created from custom game engines builded from scratch by ourselves.

Along the way, I’ve also created several solo projects for class assignments — some of which I’m particularly proud of and have shared on my website.

I’m most passionate about working on the engine side of development, especially building tools and graphics pipelines. That said, I’m always open to diving into gameplay programming and exploring other areas of game development and sofware development.
