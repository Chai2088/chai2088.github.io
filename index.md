## About Me
Hi! I’m Jiayi — but you can call me Chai.\
I’m a Computer Science graduate from DigiPen Institute of Technology, where I specialized in Real-Time Interactive Simulation. Over the past four years, I’ve collaborated on multiple team-based game projects created from custom game engines builded from scratch by ourselves.

Along the way, I’ve also created several solo projects for class assignments — some of which I’m particularly proud of and have shared on my website.

I’m most passionate about working on the engine side of development, especially building tools and graphics pipelines. That said, I’m always open to diving into gameplay programming and exploring other areas of game development and sofware development.

## Programing Languages

* C++
* C
* C#
* Python
* GLSL

## Tools

### Visual Studio
> Visual Studio is my primary IDE for software development. I'm highly proficient with it and frequently use advanced features such as the performance profiler to optimize my code.

### RenderDoc
> Debugging graphics issues can be complex, which is why I rely heavily on RenderDoc. It has become an essential tool for diagnosing and resolving rendering bugs during graphics development.

### CMake
> I use CMake regularly due to its flexibility and power. It allows me to create cross-platform projects with ease, streamlining the build process across different environments.

## Programs

### Unreal Engine
> I worked extensively with Unreal Engine during my senior year, developing a full game project. I programmed in both C++ and Unreal Blueprints, often combining the two to take full advantage of the engine’s flexibility.

### Unity
> Unity was the first game engine I learned. Since then, I’ve developed several games using it, including a platformer created in just 48 hours during a 2024 Game Jam with a teammate.

### Maya
> At university, I was introduced to 3D modeling using Maya. It gave me a solid foundation in modeling techniques. I also have prior experience with Blender, a similar tool, which helped me expand my modeling skillset.
