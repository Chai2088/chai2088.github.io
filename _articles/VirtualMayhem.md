### Shaders
> During the project I have playing around with shaders and developed a couple of shaders for the game. 
>
> * __Glitch__\
I developed a custom glitch shader to enhance the game's visual aesthetic and add a layer of stylized distortion. This effect simulates digital interference â€” with flickering lines, color channel shifts, and jittering.
>
>* __Health Bar__\
Unlike traditional health bars found in most games, this shader represents a dynamic advantage bar rather than a static health meter. It visually conveys which player currently holds the upper hand in a match.

### Story Mode System
> I designed and implemented a story log system that delivers narrative text in a controlled, sequential flow. The system allows story events to unfold gradually, enhancing immersion and pacing. Between story segments, it seamlessly triggers combat encounters, creating a dynamic interplay between storytelling and gameplay progression.

### AI Opponent
> Since the game is designed as a two-player combat experience, I developed an __AI opponent__ to ensure a compelling solo mode as well. The AI can engage the player in responsive, fast-paced combat, simulating a real opponent. To make the game accessible to a wider audience, I implemented three __difficulty levels__, allowing players of varying skill levels to enjoy the game at their own pace.
