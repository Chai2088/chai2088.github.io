__3D racing game featuring combat__ developed on a __custom engine__ based on OpenGL. This was a team project composed of 8 programmers. During this project I worked as the graphics programmer where I implemented a full featured 3D graphics pipeline. Among some rendering techniques I implemented in this project include: Cascaded Shadow Maps, Intance Rendering for Particles, PBR bloom.[Try it here](https://www.digipen.es/es/galeria/juegos-de-estudiantes/crashnburn)

### Cascaded Shadow Maps
While developing this game we came upon this challenge I had to work on which was the shadow quality, our game is a racing game meaning the map is huge, so we would also need to have an equally big shadow map, but having a single huge shadow map wasnt the best solution for our problems, as it require a huge chunk of memory, and additionatilly not all the places required a good shadow quality. 

Thus I chose this approach called cascaded shadow maps, which is a shadow rendering technique where the shadow map is split into multiple sections. Each section will render shadows at different distances from the camera. This ensures shadows closer to the camera have good quality and shadows far from the camera have less quality.

## Particle System
I designed and built a particle system in order to add extra visual effects into the game

__Key Features:__

__üéØ Billboard Optimization__

* Implemented camera-facing quads

* Renders much faster than 3D particles with similar visuals

__‚ö° Instanced Rendering__

* Batches render calls into a single render call

* Allows faster render time due to GPU friendly memory layout

* Enables higher particle counts compared to forward rendering

__üõ†Ô∏è Editor Tool__

* Created an editor for more accesible particle creation and modification

* Allows for saving and deleting of particles

* Has an attribute control panel to modify velocity, particle life...

__Impact:__

* Enchances visual quality of the game

* Very fast rendering time and allows very big quantities of particles

### Bloom
Bloom creates a glowing light effect around bright areas, making visuals feel more lifelike and cinematic. I included this feature in our game engine because it gives a more realistic feel to the light, also it blends very well to the aesthetic of the game.

## Speed FX Shaders
__üèÅ Radial Motion Blur__

* Dynamic screen-space blur intensity tied to ship velocity

* Adjustable falloff from edges to maintain center clarity

__üöÄ Velocity Rays__

* Scale opacity/width with acceleration

* Rotates depending of the velocity

__üìΩÔ∏è Camera Shake__

* Triggers a camera shake when stepping into a boost

* Creates a sensation of sudden acceleration 

## Player HUD

* Allows for 2 - 4 player displays

* Added real time lap time lap information, such as, current lap time and best lap

* Shows the player scoreboard at the end of the game

* Dynamically adjust to screen size
